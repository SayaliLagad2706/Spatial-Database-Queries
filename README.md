# Spatial-Database-Queries
- Spatial Database Queries enable visualization of geospatial data on platforms like Google Earth
- The aim of this project is to generate spatial data, query on it and visualize the query results
- A KML file is generated by collecting data for 15 different locations. Spatial queries are implemented on this data to compute convex hull polygon and k nearest neighbors from a location
- A location is fixed as center and the coordinates lying along a Spirograph curve are generated
- The result is a visualization of spatial data on platforms like Google Earth and ArcGIS

Implementation details:
  - 
  - The location data is collected around the USC campus and is further categorized in 3 types: Cafes, Parking lots and libraries
  - A convex hull polygon and 4 nearest neighbors of 'VKC library' are queried using these coordinates. 
  - A KML file is generated for all the collected and generated data and loaded on Google Earth to visualize the results on an actual map. In KML file, (long, lat) needs to be specified instead of the expected (lat, long)
  - The locations are also plotted on HTML page using OpenLayers (a JavaScript API)
  - Using JavaScript, the data points for a Spirograph curve with 'Bovard Auditorium' as the center, are generated and collected. A separate KML file is created using these points
  - This file is converted to shapefile using the converter mentioned below. The result will be a .zip file which will contain within it, shape data (.shp), a relational table (.dbf), and other optional files (.shx, .prj, .cpg).
  - Upload this shapefile in ArcGIS' online editor. Do 'Add -> Add Layer from File' to upload the shapefile and the spirograph curve should be visible on the map

Technologies used:
  -
  - KML (Keyhole Markup Language)
  - Language: JavaScript
  - DBMS: PostgreSQL, PostGIS
  - Platforms: Google Earth, ArcGIS
  - .kml to shapefile converter: https://mygeodata.cloud/converter/kml-to-shp
